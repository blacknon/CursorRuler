# CursorRuler

A plugin for the Sublime Text editor which marks the current cursor position(s) using dynamic rulers.


## Why Is This Useful?

1.  It can be used for alignment purposes in places where Sublime Text's built-in indent guides aren't able to show up.  For example, inside multiple rows of single-line comments or multiple assignment statements across different code blocks.

2.  When used alongside line highlighting it creates a crosshair effect which can be a useful visual aid.


## Features

- Use multiple dynamic rulers to create different highlighting styles including a "thickening" effect which can be used to simulate column highlighting.

- Option to synchronize rulers when using multiple views of the same file.

- Supports multiple cursors.

- Toggle activation through the command palette.

- Compatible with Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3.
